      <h1>Serif Fonts</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Serif fonts are the most commonly used typefaces in design. They were created for book printing, but modern digitized Serif font families work well for web design as well. Serif fonts are also used for titles, headings, and subtitles.</p>

      <h2>Old Style Serifs</h2>
      <p>Old-style typefaces date back to 1465, shortly after Johannes Gutenberg's adoption of the movable type printing press. Early printers in Italy created types that broke with Gutenberg's blackletter printing, creating upright ("roman") and then oblique ("italic") styles that were inspired by Renaissance calligraphy. The first modern serif typeface was designed by Carl Barker in 1930.</p>

      <h2>Transitional Serifs</h2>
      <p>Transitional, or baroque, serif typefaces first became common around the mid-18th century until the start of the 19th.[36] They are in between "old style" and "modern" fonts, thus the name "transitional". Differences between thick and thin lines are more pronounced than they are in old style, but less dramatic than they are in the Didone fonts that followed.</p>

      <h2>Modern Serif Fonts</h2>
      <p>Didone, or modern, serif typefaces, which first emerged in the late 18th century, are characterized by extreme contrast between thick and thin lines. These typefaces have a vertical stress and thin serifs with a constant width, with minimal bracketing (constant width). Serifs tend to be very thin, and vertical lines very heavy. Didone fonts are often considered to be less readable than transitional or old-style serif typefaces.</p>
